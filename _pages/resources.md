We are currently working on all of our organization-wide documentation and
governance. The guidebook links below are being updated and we welcome feedback!

* [**pyOpenSci Github Organization**](https://github.com/pyOpenSci): Contains our [software-review](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review) repo that hosts the peer-review process. Also contains our guidebook, cookiecutter, and handbook repos (see below).

* [**pyOpenSci Peer Review**](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/): Contains information for package authors and reviewers.

* [**pyOpenSci's Handbook**](https://www.pyopensci.org/handbook/): Where we discuss the direction and scope of pyOpenSci. We're a community organization, so please feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/handbook/issues) if you have any questions or concerns!
