  - excerpt: "Our open peer review process facilitates scientists getting credit and recognition for the work they've invested in developing scientific Python tools. The peer review process also supports scientists in finding vetted and maintained software, which drives their open science workflows."

    excerpt: "Software peer review, similar to the review of scientific papers, is a process where scientists vet software code, documentation and infrastructure. pyOpenSci leads an [open peer review process](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/our-process/how-review-works.html) run by a community of dedicated volunteers. Reviews are supportive and fully transparent with the shared goal of improving the quality, usability and maintainability of the software that is driving open science.

    * Diverse teams lead each review, enhancing the overall feedback quality."

## Meet our editorial board

The pyOpenSci software peer review process is led by a volunteer team of
editors from the scientific Python community. Editors do the following things:

* They find reviewers from diverse backgrounds who have a mixture of scientific domain and Python experience.
* They oversee the entire review process for a package ensuring it runs in a timely and efficient manner
* They support the submitting authors and reviewers in answering questions related to the review
* They determine whether that package should be accepted into the pyOpenSci ecosystem once the review has wrapped up.

Learn more about the
editor role at pyOpenSci [in our peer review guide.](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/editors-guide.html)
