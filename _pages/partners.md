                    pyOpenSci adds an extra layer of community-specific review to
                    our established open peer review process. This allows domain-specific scientific Python communities to vet  affiliated tools through our robust peer review process. Affiliated packages can also get published in JOSS if they are in scope.

## Increased visibility for your communities' tools

We will:

- Promote your community and it's packages on our website.
- Post about your affiliated packages on our social media channels.
- List your package on our [packages page](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-packages.html).
- Provide a feed allowing you to cross-list affiliated packages on your website too.
- Keep in touch with maintainers to ensure packages are actively maintained.

## Help scientists find the tools that they need

pyOpenSci wants to make it easier for scientists to find vetted and maintained tools
that they can use in their open science workflows.

</div>

<div class="pyos-section purple" markdown="1">
## Leverage our existing peer review process

Your community can take advantage of our existing, developed and well-documented peer review process which includes:

- **A diverse and growing team of editors.** We ask partner communities to have at least 2 members of their community on our editorial team. We want our partner community to make the final decision on whether a package should receive the label of being "affiliated". Typically an editor will run 2-4 reviews a year. **learn more here. **
- **A suite of community reviewers whose expertise spans numerous scientific domains.** We ask that partner communities help us find reviews in their specific domain areas as packages come in for review. Learn more about peer review here.
- **Community driven packaging resources and guidelines:** Our packaging guidelines are what drive the peer review process. Rather than communities creating their own individual guidelines, we hope that partners can join us in expanding our packaging resources as it makes sense.

## Let's make packaging easier for scientists, together

Given the numerous diverse packaging options, many communities are crafting their guidelines and review processes. Partnering with pyOpenSci enables your community to:

- tap into and contribute to an established community-owned set of packaging standards.
- mitigate the redundancy of multiple communities creating their own processes and standards.

Over time, aligning packaging criteria will support increased
consistency in packaging approaches across the ecosystem.
This consistency will also lower the barrier of entry for potential package contributors in the ecosystem.

## Harness the power of community

At its core, pyOpenSci is a thriving community composed of technical packaging experts, open science enthusiasts, and Python enthusiasts. When you partner with or join pyOpenSci, you become part of a community rich in expertise, ready to assist you with your packaging challenges.

Our membership includes individuals from conda, conda-forge, PyPA, and even core developers who are available to answer your packaging-related questions.

For package maintainers, we offer support in case they need to step down from their maintenance roles. We will make every effort to assist in finding a new maintainer or, if necessary, gracefully sunset or archive the package for safekeeping.

## Raising the bar for Scientific Python software

More packages going through our review process means
we're all working together to raise the bar in terms of
quality, documentation and usability of scientific software.

By reviewing packages from the entire ecosystem, pyOpenSci can identify redundancy in package functionality and areas where maintainers could benefit from consolidation efforts.

</div>
<div class="pyos-section purple" markdown="1">
## How peer review works

The pyOpenSci peer review process can be broken down into 5 steps when a package is submitted for review:

1. To kick things off, an Editor-in-Chief checks that the package passes our [bare-minimum checks](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/editor-in-chief-guide.html#editor-checklist-template).
2. Once checks are passed the editor in chief assign a domain-expert editor to the review. Ideally this editor is from your community so they can perform any community-specific affiliated package checks.
3. The editor finds 2 reviewers to begin the review.
4. THe review begins and is a conversation between the package maintainer and the reviewer with the goal of improving the package usability and quality.
5. Once the package is accepted by pyOpenSci, authors can opt for a JOSS fast track. If within JOSS's scope, JOSS will accept the pyOpenSci review and only reviews the JOSS paper.

Through the above steps, an accepted package can become pyOpenSci accepted, JOSS published and an official affiliated package with your community.

**The editor for the package review then makes the final decision on acceptance into the community ecosystem as affiliated.**

</div>

## Why do so many scientific Python communities exist?

Within the Python ecosystem, various science-domain-specific communities are creating peer review processes to evaluate community-affiliated tools.

- A response to the need to vet and maintain a list of high-quality tools that their communities embrace
- A need to track software maintenance to ensure ecosystem tools in their vetted lists are maintained
- The need for packaging guidance given a complex packaging ecosystem filled with numerous tools and options

However, creating a review process for software requires significant effort.

[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) is most mature of the domain-specific communities that we work with, having built its peer review process in 2013.

### Our affiliated package review process

    <figcaption>Our domain-specific partnerships allow organizations with a scientific domain focus to take advantage of the existing, developed pyOpenSci peer review process. through this partnership, we add an additional layer of community specific vetting to our existing review process that will allow a package to become both accepted by pyOpenSci and affiliated with the domain community through a single-end-to-end review process.</figcaption>
