    excerpt: "It can be hard for scientists to find the maintained tools that they need in our diverse scientific Python ecosystem. A catalog of vetted open source tools makes it easier for scientists to find the dependable tools that they need for their open science workflows."

mission:
  - excerpt: "PyOpenSci collaborates with domain-specific communities to streamline
our diverse ecosystem. Instead of creating new review processing and packaging
guidelines, partner organizations can leverage and contribute to our existing review processes and guidelines."

     title: "Let's make packaging easier for scientists, together"
     excerpt: "Given the numerous diverse packaging options, many communities are crafting their guidelines and review processes. Partnering with pyOpenSci enables your community to:

     * tap into and contribute to an established community-owned set of packaging standards.

     * mitigate the redundancy of multiple communities creating their own processes and standards.


     Aligning packaging criteria will support increased consistency in packaging approaches across the ecosystem. This consistency will  lower the barrier of entry for new potential contributors."

     excerpt: "
At its core, pyOpenSci is a thriving community composed of technical packaging experts, open science enthusiasts, and Python enthusiasts. When you partner with or join pyOpenSci, you become part of a community rich in expertise, ready to assist you with your packaging challenges.

Our membership includes individuals from conda, conda-forge, PyPA, and even core developers who are available to answer your packaging-related questions.

For package maintainers, we offer support in case they need to step down from their maintenance roles. We will make every effort to assist in finding a new maintainer or, if necessary, gracefully sunset or archive the package for safekeeping."

## Increase visibility for your communities' tools

We will:

- Promote your community and its packages on our website.
- Post about your affiliated packages on our social media channels.
- List your package on our [packages page](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-packages.html).
- Provide a feed allowing you to cross-list affiliated packages on your website.
- Keep in touch with maintainers to ensure packages are actively maintained.

## Leverage our peer review process

Your community can take advantage of our existing, developed and well-documented peer review process which includes:

- **A diverse and growing team of editors.** We ask partner communities to have at least 2 members of their community on our editorial team. We want our partner community to make the final decision on whether a package should receive the label of being "affiliated". Typically an editor will run 2-4 reviews a year. [**Learn more about the editor role.**](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/editors-guide.html)
- **A suite of community reviewers whose expertise spans numerous scientific domains.** We ask that partner communities help us find reviews in their specific domain areas as packages come in for review. [Learn more about the requirements for reviewers.](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/reviewer-guide.html)
- **Community driven packaging resources and guidelines:** Our packaging guidelines are what drive the peer review process. Rather than communities creating their own individual guidelines, we hope that partners can join us in expanding our packaging resources as it makes sense.

## Raising the bar for Scientific Python software

More packages going through our review process means
we're all working together to raise the bar in terms of
quality, documentation and usability of scientific software.

By reviewing packages from the entire ecosystem, pyOpenSci can identify redundancy in package functionality and areas where maintainers could benefit from consolidation efforts.

## Why do so many scientific Python communities exist?

Within the Python ecosystem, various science-domain-specific communities are creating peer review processes to evaluate community-affiliated tools.

- A response to the need to vet and maintain a list of high-quality tools that their communities embrace
- A need to track software maintenance to ensure ecosystem tools in their vetted lists are maintained
- The need for packaging guidance given a complex packaging ecosystem filled with numerous tools and options

However, creating a review process for software requires significant effort.
pyOpenSci was created to target these exact issues in support of open science.

[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) is most mature of the domain-specific communities that we work with, having built its peer review process in 2013.

### Our affiliated package review process

    <a href="/images/peer-review/peer-review-partners-process.png"><img src="/images/peer-review/peer-review-partners-process.png" alt="ADD ALT"></a>
    <figcaption>Our domain-specific partnerships allow organizations with a scientific domain focus to take advantage of the existing, developed pyOpenSci peer review process. through this partnership, we add an additional layer of community specific vetting to our existing review process that will allow a package to become both accepted by pyOpenSci and affiliated with the domain community through a single-end-to-end review process.</figcaption>
