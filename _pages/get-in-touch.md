    alt:
    excerpt: "Are you developing or maintaining a scientific Python package that is in scope for our peer review process? If so, consider submitting it for peer review. We partner with JOSS so you can submit to us and JOSS will accept our review as theirs. They then just review your paper. It's a win/win! Check out our [author guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/author-guide.html) to learn more about the process. Pro-tip: If you still aren't sure if your package is in scope for us, you can submit a pre-submission inquiry."
