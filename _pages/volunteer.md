## pyOpenSci volunteers come from diverse backgrounds

Our volunteers come from a diverse array of backgrounds, including industry, academia, agencies, national labs, and more. pyOpenSci volunteers are primarily engaged in both the peer review process and developing resources to support the scientific Python community. Volunteers  help improve the quality, maintainability and usability of the software that scientists need for open science. They also support maintainers in developing scientific Python software.

## pyOpenSci volunteers build skills and community

When you volunteer with pyOpenSci, you’re not only giving back to the community, but also:

- **Learning new skills:** you don’t have to be a Python expert to get involved with pyOpenSci. We can help you level up your packaging game and learn how to constructively review both code and copy through contributions to our online learning resources.
- **Connecting with peers:** our [public Discourse forum](https://pyopensci.discourse.group/) is a great place to ask and answer questions, as well as discuss packaging and open science with other Pythonistas.
- **Being recognized** on the [pyOpenSci website](https://www.pyopensci.org/our-community/index.html) and [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/pyOpenSci): your contribution matters, and we want to ensure your work is recognized and celebrated in a public forum.
