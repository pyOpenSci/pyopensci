## pyOpenSci is now an independent community organization

I am thrilled to announce that pyOpenSci is now a fiscally sponsored project of
Community Initiatives! This means that pyOpenSci now serves the community of
scientific python users and open source software maintainers. pyOpenSci is not
affiliated with any specific organization. I (Leah) will now be devoting ALL of my
(work :)) time to the pyOpenSci project full time as the official Executive Director.

## pyOpenSci’s current funding and structure

I am grateful for 2 years of funding from the Sloan Foundation to
support this effort. Once I acquire additional funding, I
will be able to hire more staff to grow the organization. I am working with a
board of two right now: Tracy Teal (chair) and Karen Cranston. They both bring
tremendous experience building and supporting The Carpentries, among other
efforts; Tracy and Karen will guide me in propelling pyOpenSci forward. I also am
working with two incredible editors that have been crucial in supporting peer
review: David Nicholson and Ivan Ogasawara. In the upcoming months we will
recruit more editors to support our open source software review process.
Finally, I am also continuing to coordinate with and learn from the
well-established and successful rOpenSci. rOpenSci has set the precedent for
this type of organization in this space and I am grateful for their ongoing
support.

## pyOpenSci is not just peer review of open source software
Peer review is critical to the pyOpenSci mission but have bigger and broader
aspirations too. There are several organization
goals supported by the Sloan Foundation grant that we will be working on over
the next few years:
* Create and grow a diverse and supportive community around a dynamic and
open peer review process and Python open science skills. Diversity is important and we plan to bake diversity focused programs into all of pyOpenSci activities from the beginning.
* Streamline and improve the quality of smaller (think api wrappers, spatial data tools and domain specific tools rather than Numpy and Pandas) Python Scientific Open Source software tools that support scientific workflows.   
  * We do this through peer review which assess not only code but and usability, documentation and ensures alignment with community accepted standards for packaging.
  * Our peer review processing considers usability of the tools which includes documentation and “vignettes” that showcase tool functionality and provide easy quickstarts for users.
  * Once tools are accepted into our ecosystem, we will track tool maintenance and find new maintainers, or support sunsetting as it makes sense to ensure users aren't left hanging.
  * Through peer review we will also address redundancy in tool functionality across the scientific python ecosystem.
* Create a model to support peer review within domain specific subcommunities. We will begin our work here with the Pangeo community. Here, we will support a peer review process with community-specific standards applied on top of ours to ensure tool consistency.   
* Provide training and mentorship in skills needed to contribute to open source. These skills are not just for open source. They are also fundamental to good open science practices and will support career trajectories in open science too.
* Grow support for maintainers. A critical component of this effort will be a communication campaign around the importance of open source to science.

## We will also continue to curate our partnership with the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS).
Package maintainers can still submit a package to us if they wish to publish with
JOSS. Our partnership supports a "fast track" review in JOSS if its functionality
fits their scope and requirements. Once a package is accepted by pyOpenSci , if
the package fits into the JOSS scope our review will count towards JOSS. A package
author then only needs to write a paper for JOSS, and they will be "dual"
published with us and JOSS. This, friends, is a win-win!

## Who do we serve?
pyOpenSci supports maintainers of smaller scientific python open source projects.
We also support scientists using these tools and will empower folks like you
with the skills needed to both contribute to Open Source and improve your open
science workflows! In the long term these skills will be invaluable in your
data intensive career trajectory!

## pyOpenSci is about collaboration - not reinventing the wheel
Collaborations with existing efforts are critical. I welcome any feedback from
you regarding groups that we should be engaging with! I will also need help
finding reviewers and editors, mentors to support training efforts and voices to
spread the word about the project.

## And… what's the timeline?
Unless I figure out how to create numerous robot clones of myself, please know
that all of the above won’t happen immediately. I am currently the sole
employee of the organization and this is my second week. But never fear - we
will accomplish a lot in the next two years and look forward to and will greatly
value support from some of you along the way!

## Stay in touch!
There are many ways to stay in touch with our project. Once I have a road map
for activities developed, I will communicate this here on our
[website](https://www.pyopensci.org/), Twitter
and discourse. So be sure to follow [@pyOpenSci on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/pyopensci).

## What can you do now?
There are a few ways to get involved with us now.

1. [You can sign up to be a reviewer by filling out our reviewer form](https://forms.gle/B6zAukLCvJot5nws6). If you do this, we will reach out to you if a package is submitted that suits your background and interests!
  * We will also be growing our editorial board in the upcoming months. Once you have reviewed for us you are eligible to be considered as an editor. We will be posting more about this process in the upcoming months.
1. Our open peer review process is running! If you have a package that you are working on, [you can submit it to our peer review process](https://github.com/pyOpenSci/software-review/issues).
  * You can learn more about our review process here in our [community guide (which will be updated in the upcoming months so that it is more clear)](https://www.pyopensci.org/contributing-guide/open-source-software-peer-review/aims-and-scope.html).
  * If you have a package that you wish to submit but need some guidance, you can also submit a presubmission inquiry or a request for help here.
1. You can [follow us on twitter](https://www.twitter.com/pyopensci) to keep tabs on our progress. 

If you want to stay in touch with me, feel free to follow me on

me on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/lwasser).

## pyOpenSci was built with support from numerous community members
I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank the huge suite of community
members who participated in early meetings and discussions surrounding pyOpenSci.
Please note that this list is not comprehensive and likely misses folks who
attended discussions held at sciPy a few years prior to my involvement and those
who's names I am missing on meeting notes. Feel free to reach out and ask for
corrections as needed!  Max Joseph, Jenny Palomino, Kylen Solvik, Chris Holdgraf,
Paige Bailey, Luiz Irber,
Arfon Smith, Leonardo Uieda, Filipe Fernandes, Carson Farmer, Neil Chue Hong,
Joe Hamman, Ryan Abernathy, Lindsey Heagy, Noam Ross, Karthik Ram, Martin Skarzynski,
Levi Wolf, Daniel Chen, Ivan Ogsawara, David Nicholson, Tania Allard,
Kirstie Whitaker, Sander van Rijn, Philip Meier, Moritz Lurig ... and so many
more!

I am so excited to be leading this effort and look forward to keeping in touch
with everyone and supporting the community as pyOpenSci grows.

More to come... soon!
