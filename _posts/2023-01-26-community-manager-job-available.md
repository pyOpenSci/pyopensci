## Job Posting: pyOpenSci Community Manager / Developer Advocate

pyOpenSci is accepting applications for a Community Manager. The Community 
Manager supports the creation of an inclusive pyOpenSci community that is 
dedicated to high quality Python open source software. 

## About pyOpenSci
pyOpenSci is a diverse scientific open source community that develops processes 
and standards for creation and maintenance of scientific Python packages. We 
also have a mission to increase participation of groups that have historically 
underrepresented / excluded from the open source community 
through both mentorship and strategic partnerships with existing organizations 
such as [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/), [Open Science Labs](https://opensciencelabs.org/), [pyLadies](https://pyladies.com/), [geoLatinas](https://geolatinas.org/) and other 
organizations.

pyOpenSci’s core program is open peer review of scientific Python software. 
Through that program we enforce community-defined packaging standards while 
improving usability, documentation and package quality. Further, our goal is to 
curate a database of vetted scientific Python tools that have ongoing 
maintenance. 

pyOpenSci is a community owned organization, fiscally sponsored by Community Initiatives.  

## What we are looking for 
We are looking for someone with experience managing large, diverse online 
communities. We hope that you are excited about facilitating outreach activities 
and developing community partnerships. We also want you to be committed to 
increasing diversity in the scientific open source software community. Ideally 
you are also familiar with the Python programming language and goals of open 
science. 

This position provides the opportunity for someone to drive the pyOpenSci 
mission of building a diverse and supportive community forward. This is a 
part-time position (.75-.8 FTE) with full benefits. This position will report

Review of applications will begin on Feb 9, 2023 and will be ongoing until the

grant funded. Current funds allocated through June 2024. Assuming project 
success during the first two years, we will seek additional funding to extend 
the work beyond June 2024. This position is fully remote. While our reach is 
global, we prefer that you live in the United States.
